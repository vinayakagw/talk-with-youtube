# Talk With YouTube

## What I Built
Talk With YouTube is a full-stack application that downloads audio from YouTube videos, transcribes it using Sarvam AI's Speech-to-Text capabilities, and creates an interactive Q&A experience powered by Sarvam AI's LLM. Users can ask questions about video content using their voice and receive spoken responses, creating a natural conversation experience.

## Who It's For
- Content learners who want to extract specific information from long videos
- Students who need to query educational content effectively
- Researchers analyzing video interviews or presentations
- Anyone who prefers voice interaction over reading lengthy transcripts

## Why It Matters
- Transforms passive video consumption into an interactive learning experience
- Makes video content more accessible through natural language Q&A
- Showcases how Sarvam AI's suite of APIs can be combined to create innovative applications

## Features

*   **YouTube Video Processing**: Downloads audio from a YouTube video URL.
*   **Transcription**: Transcribes the downloaded audio using Sarvam AI's batch Speech-to-Text (STT) service.
*   **LLM-Powered Q&A**: Ask questions about the video's content and get answers generated by Sarvam AI's LLM based on the transcript.
*   **Voice Input**: Record questions using your microphone, which are then transcribed using Sarvam AI's real-time STT.
*   **Voice Output**: Hear the LLM's answers spoken back using Sarvam AI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) service.
*   **Chatbot Interface**: Interact with the Q&A system through a user-friendly chat interface.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend**: Python, Flask
*   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **AI Services**:
    *   Sarvam AI STT (Batch and Realtime)
    *   Sarvam AI LLM
    *   Sarvam AI TTS
*   **Libraries/Tools**:
    *   `yt-dlp`: For downloading YouTube video audio.
    *   `sounddevice`: For microphone audio recording.
    *   `requests`: For making HTTP API calls.
    *   `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
    *   FFmpeg: Required by `yt-dlp` and for audio concatenation.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   FFmpeg:
    *   On macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
    *   On Linux: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`
    *   On Windows: Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd talk-with-youtube
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (`/Users/vinayakagarwal/Desktop/talk-with-youtube/.env`).
    Add the following required variables:

    ```env
    SARVAM_API_KEY="your_sarvam_ai_api_key"
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY="a_strong_random_secret_key_for_flask_sessions"
    ```
    *   Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and configurations.

## Running the Application

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run the Flask application from the project root directory:
    ```bash
    python -m app.main
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to:
    `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (or the port specified in `app/main.py`).

## Notes

*   The application uses Sarvam AI APIs, which may have usage limits or costs associated with them depending on your Sarvam AI account plan.
*   Microphone access permission will be required by your browser for the voice input feature.

**Before committing:**

1.  Make sure you have a `.env` file in your project root with your actual secrets, and it is **not** committed to Git (the `.gitignore` entry for `.env` will ensure this).
2.  Review the `.gitignore` to ensure it covers all temporary and sensitive files specific to your workflow. For example, if `app/static/tts_audio/` should always be empty in the repository, you might add a `.gitkeep` file inside it if you want to track the directory itself, or just let Git ignore the WAV files within it. The current `.gitignore` ignores WAV files inside `app/static/tts_audio/`.# filepath: /Users/vinayakagarwal/Desktop/talk-with-youtube/README.md
